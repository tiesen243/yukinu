# Cookie Policy

This Cookie Policy explains how Yukinu uses cookies and similar technologies in this educational project.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your web browser. They help websites function properly, remember preferences, and understand how users interact with the website.

## How Yukinu Uses Cookies

Since this is a non-commercial learning project, cookies may be used for:

- Basic session functionality (e.g., staying signed in during a test session)
- Authentication and security during testing
- Debugging and performance insights while developing the system

No advertising or tracking cookies are intentionally used.

## Third-Party Cookies

If you choose to log in using third-party OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), those services may set their own cookies. Yukinu does not control how those cookies are used.  
Please review the respective third-party privacy policies for more information.

## No Real Personal Tracking

This project does **not**:

- Track real-world user behavior for marketing
- Sell or share personal data with advertisers
- Use analytics services for commercial profiling

Any analytics used are solely for development and performance testing.

## Managing Cookies

You can manage or disable cookies in your browser settings at any time.  
However, disabling essential cookies may affect the basic functionality of the app.

## Updates to This Policy

As Yukinu evolves for research or learning improvements, this Cookie Policy may be updated. Changes will be reflected directly in this document.
