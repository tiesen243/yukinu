# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 29, 2025_

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Yukinu demonstration project (“the Project”). This Project is created for educational and non-commercial purposes. No real transactions, payments, or personal data collection are intended.

By using this Project, you acknowledge that the system is a study prototype and not a real commercial service.

This Project does **not** actively collect or store real personal information. Any data input into the system is considered **test data**.

Example of test data types:

- Demo usernames
- Fake vendor profiles
- Sample product listings
- Mock order records

If a user voluntarily enters real personal information, they do so at their own discretion.

## 2. Use of Data

All test data entered into this Project is used only for:

- Demonstration of software features
- Testing database operations
- Academic learning purposes

No data will be:

- Sold
- Shared with third parties
- Used for marketing

## 3. Cookies and Tracking

This Project may use minimal technical cookies solely for:

- Session handling
- Login persistence during a browser session

No tracking, analytics, or advertising cookies are used.

## 4. Data Security

While basic security measures may be implemented, this Project is not hardened for production. Users should **not** store sensitive personal data.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This Project is not intended for real end users, including children. No data about minors is knowingly processed.

## 6. External Services

If external services (e.g., authentication providers, cloud database) are used for educational purposes, applicable policies from those providers will apply independently.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements during development.

Revisions will maintain the core statement that the Project is **non-commercial**.

## 8. Contact

For inquiries related to learning or project usage, please contact the developer directly.
