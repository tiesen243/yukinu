# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: October 29, 2025_

This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to data in the Yukinu project. This application is a **non-commercial, educational demonstration**, and your privacy is a top priority.

## 1. Our Core Privacy Principle: We Don't Collect Your Real Data

This project is designed for demonstration purposes only. We do **not** want, need, or knowingly collect any real personal information from you.

Any data you enter into forms—such as names, emails, or addresses—is treated as **temporary, fictional data** for testing the application's features. Please do not enter real, sensitive personal information.

## 2. What Happens to the Data You Enter?

The demonstration data you provide is used solely for:

- **Functionality Testing**: To show how features like user registration, product creation, and order placement work.
- **Database Demonstration**: To populate the database for educational purposes.

We will **never**:

- Sell or rent your information.
- Share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.
- Use the information for any commercial activity.

All data in the demonstration database may be periodically erased without notice.

## 3. Third-Party Services

For demonstration purposes, this project may integrate with third-party services, such as:

- **Authentication Providers** (e.g., Google, GitHub): If you choose to log in via a third party, that provider will handle your authentication. We only receive a basic identifier (like your email address and name) to create a session. We do not receive your password. The third party's privacy policy governs their data handling.
- **File Storage** (e.g., Uploadthing): For demonstration of image uploads. Please do not upload sensitive or personal images.

## 4. Security

While we implement standard security practices (like password hashing), this project is not hardened for a production environment. You use this demonstration application at your own risk and should not trust it with sensitive data.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This project is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the project. We will post any updates on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please **[open an issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tiesen243/yukinu/issues)**.
