## User Management

- **View All Users**: Access a complete list of all registered users on the platform, including customers and vendors.
- **Activate/Deactivate Users**: You can activate new user accounts or deactivate existing ones. Deactivating a user will prevent them from logging in and making purchases.

## Vendor Management

- **Vendor Approval**: Review applications from businesses wanting to become vendors on the platform. You have the authority to approve or deny these applications.
- **Suspend Vendors**: If a vendor violates the platform's terms of service, you can temporarily or permanently suspend their selling privileges.
- **View All Vendors**: Monitor the list of all active and suspended vendors.

## Content and Product Management

- **Category Management**: You are responsible for creating, editing, and deleting the global product categories that vendors use to classify their items. This ensures a consistent and organized catalog.
- **Product Moderation**: While vendors manage their own products, administrators have the ability to moderate and override any product listing on the site. This is a tool to ensure quality and compliance with platform policies.

## System-wide Configuration

- **Roles & Permissions**: The platform supports a role-based access control system. You can manage which roles have access to which features. _(This is an advanced feature and may be configured at the database level)._

## Analytics (Future)

The Admin Dashboard is planned to include system-wide analytics, providing insights into:

- Overall sales volume and revenue.
- Platform growth metrics (new users, new vendors).
- Popular products and categories across the entire marketplace.
