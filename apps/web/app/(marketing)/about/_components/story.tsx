          Yukinu was founded with a simple observation: the most successful
          online marketplaces give equal opportunity to sellers of all sizes
          while providing buyers with unmatched product variety and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw friction in traditional e-commerce where hidden costs,
          complicated seller onboarding, and opaque policies frustrated both
          merchants and customers. We decided to build something different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting as a lean team of e-commerce and technology enthusiasts, we
          created Yukinu to be the anti-intermediary platform. We prioritize
          seller success, invest in buyer protection, and use technology to
          eliminate unnecessary complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Yukinu serves thousands of sellers and millions of shoppers,
          growing steadily by maintaining our core principles: fairness,
          transparency, and a relentless focus on user experience.
